</details>


### Installing FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for spotDL. If using FFmpeg only for spotDL, you can simply install FFmpeg to your spotDL installation directory:
`spotdl --download-ffmpeg`

We recommend the above option, but if you want to install FFmpeg system-wide,
follow these instructions

- [Windows Tutorial](https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/)
- OSX - `brew install ffmpeg`
- Linux - `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or use your distro's package manager

## Usage

Using SpotDL without options::
```sh
spotdl [urls]
```
You can run _spotDL_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:
```sh
python -m spotdl [urls]
```

General usage:
```sh
spotdl [operation] [options] QUERY
```

There are different **operations** spotDL can perform. The *default* is `download`, which simply downloads the songs from YouTube and embeds metadata.

The **query** for spotDL is usually a list of Spotify URLs, but for some operations like **sync**, only a single link or file is required.
For a list of all **options** use ```spotdl -h```

<details>
<summary style="font-size:1em"><strong>Supported operations</strong></summary>

- `save`: Saves only the metadata from Spotify without downloading anything.
    - Usage:
        `spotdl save [query] --save-file {filename}.spotdl`

- `web`: Starts a web interface instead of using the command line. However, it has limited features and only supports downloading single songs.

- `url`: Get direct download link for each song from the query.
    - Usage:
        `spotdl url [query]`

- `sync`: Updates directories. Compares the directory with the current state of the playlist. Newly added songs will be downloaded and removed songs will be deleted. No other songs will be downloaded and no other files will be deleted.

    - Usage:
        `spotdl sync [query] --save-file {filename}.spotdl`

        This create a new **sync** file, to update the directory in the future, use:

        `spotdl sync {filename}.spotdl`

- `meta`: Updates metadata for the provided song files.

## Music Sourcing and Audio Quality

spotDL uses YouTube as a source for music downloads. This method is used to avoid any issues related to downloading music from Spotify.

### Audio Quality

spotDL downloads music from YouTube and is designed to always download the highest possible bitrate; which is 128 kbps for regular users and 256 kbps for YouTube Music premium users.
